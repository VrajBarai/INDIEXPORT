PROJECT TITLE:IndiExport
Import–Export Marketplace Web Application

-----------------------------------------
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
This project is a web-based B2B Import–Export Marketplace that connects Indian sellers with
domestic and international buyers on a single digital platform.

The system helps sellers list products and helps buyers search, compare, and communicate
with sellers. Instead of direct online payment, the platform focuses on inquiry handling,
RFQ (Request for Quotation), real-time chat, shipping details, and invoice generation.

The project is inspired by platforms like Alibaba and IndiaMART but designed as a
student-friendly and scalable system.
